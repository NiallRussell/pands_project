# Analysis of Fisher's Iris Dataset
This dataset contains data on 150 individual flowers. 
Three species are included, each containing 50 flowers. 
Petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width are recorded for each flower

## About this Project
This repository includes the dataset in csv format and a program called analysis.py which:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, 
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate. (INCLUDE ANALYSIS HERE)

## Use of this Project
This project can be used to obtain an overview of the variables in the Fisher's Iris dataset. 

A histogram of each variable is saved to png files, which can be viewed to assess the distribution of each variable

Scatter plots help to visualise the association between variable pairs, and a scatter plot is generated for each variable pair
